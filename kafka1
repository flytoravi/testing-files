Different Kafka API versions might have different vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these if the broker is backward-compatible with vulnerable versions.
Attackers may deliberately introduce a high volume of data, causing consumer lags and potential service interruptions.
Malicious actors might manipulate the offset to reprocess or skip messages, leading to potential data loss or repeated data processing.
Attackers may exploit default credentials to gain unauthorized access to Kafka.
Attackers could flood the Kafka API, consuming all available resources and causing potential service disruptions.
Some third-party connectors or plugins might introduce vulnerabilities or might be misconfigured.
If interbroker communication isn't encrypted, an attacker can potentially sniff data being transferred between brokers.
Java Management Extensions (JMX) ports, if exposed and unprotected, can be a point of entry for attackers.
Attackers may insert malicious records in the hope they become the compacted values, thereby persisting in the logs.
Without proper encryption, data in transit can be intercepted and accessed by malicious actors.
Using outdated Kafka or Java versions can make the system vulnerable to known exploits.
By targeting specific partitions, attackers might cause data unavailability for certain topics.
If quotas aren't properly set or enforced, a producer could potentially flood the Kafka cluster with data.
Attackers can deliberately produce excessive messages, consuming all available resources and potentially crashing the Kafka brokers.
If not properly secured, attackers can manipulate schemas, leading to potential data corruption.
Through the Control API, malicious actors could potentially create, delete, or alter topics.
Without stringent authentication, unauthorized producers can send malicious data into Kafka topics.
Without proper authentication and authorization, unauthorized users can access Kafka topics and consume messages, potentially accessing sensitive data.
By sending a large number of requests or large-size messages, an attacker might exhaust system resources.
Kafka's reliance on Zookeeper for distributed management can be exploited if Zookeeper's security is misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access.
