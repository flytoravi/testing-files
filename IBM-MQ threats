The administrative interface, if exposed, can be a point of entry for attackers to control the entire MQ environment.
Attackers might alter the properties of an MQ channel, potentially leading to misrouted messages or denial of service.
In IBM MQ clusters, malicious actors might alter configuration to route messages to unauthorized or malicious nodes.
Attackers might exploit default admin or app credentials to gain unauthorized access to IBM MQ.
Attackers might deliberately try to create excessive connections to the queue manager, leading to potential service disruptions.
If logs are not properly secured, attackers might alter or delete logs to hide malicious activities.
Attackers could potentially redirect legitimate messages to other queues, leading to potential data breaches or missed processing.
Without proper message integrity mechanisms, attackers can alter the content of messages in transit or at rest.
If MQ channels are not properly encrypted, attackers can potentially intercept and read message data during transit.
Attackers could send fraudulent messages to queues by impersonating legitimate publishers, leading to misinformation or service disruptions.
Attackers can overload queues with excessive messages, potentially leading to service disruptions or resource exhaustion.
If not properly secured, the MQ queue manager can be accessed and controlled, leading to potential service disruptions or message manipulation.
By altering queue properties, attackers might change the behavior of the queue, like persistence or priority, impacting message delivery.
Without strong authentication and authorization, attackers might read, write or delete messages from MQ queues, leading to data leaks or denial of service.
Using outdated IBM MQ versions can expose the system to known exploits, leading to potential data breaches or service disruptions.
