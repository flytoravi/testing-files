Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to run malicious code remotely, giving unauthorized access or control over server resources.
Attackers exploit inadequate input validation to access directories and files outside the intended directory structure.
Attackers insert malicious SQL code into query strings, leading to unauthorized data viewing, corruption, or other malicious activities.
Attackers exploit vulnerable XML processors to reference external entities, leading to unauthorized file viewing, denial of service, or SSRF.
Attackers pass crafted serialized objects to an application. Deserializing these objects may lead to RCE or other malicious activities.
Attackers manipulate an application to send malicious requests, potentially allowing interactions with internal resources.
Attackers manipulate input, such as URLs or form data, to access unauthorized objects leading to unauthorized data access or alteration.
Attackers send data to a buffer in quantities exceeding its capacity, leading to overflow. This can result in system crashes or RCE.
Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages. When executed, these scripts can steal information, modify web content, or act on behalf of authenticated users without consent.
Attackers deceive users into unknowingly submitting requests to a web application, leading to unauthorized actions.
Attackers identify and exploit flaws in application's logic or business processes, resulting in unauthorized actions or bypassing controls.
Attackers capture or predict a user's session ID to impersonate them, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data access, or account takeover.
Attackers intercept, modify, or redirect communications between a user and an application server.
Attackers exploit weak or misconfigured authorization mechanisms to perform unauthorized actions.
Poor logging and monitoring allow attackers to carry out malicious activities undetected, delaying incident response and increasing potential damage.
Attackers modify parameters (e.g., URL, form inputs) to alter application data or behavior.
Attackers inject malicious commands into vulnerable applications to be executed on the server.
Attackers consume excessive application resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to denial of service.
Attackers exploit inadequate authentication, session management, or credential management to impersonate users.
Attackers locate and exploit hard-coded credentials in software to gain unauthorized access.
Attackers overwhelm the target system, application, or network with traffic, causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
