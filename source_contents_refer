1.Attackers gain unauthorized access to sensitive Elasticsearch indices and documents. This threat often arises due to lack of authentication, weak passwords, or improperly configured access rights.
2.Attackers exploit Elasticsearch clusters that are exposed to the internet with default configurations, leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
3.Attackers execute arbitrary code on Elasticsearch nodes by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, potentially compromising the entire cluster.
4.Attackers alter documents or indices in Elasticsearch, leading to data integrity issues, misinformation, or application malfunctions.
5.Attackers overload Elasticsearch with numerous queries, potentially causing it to crash or slow down, thereby denying service to legitimate users.
6.Attackers query Elasticsearch's metadata or system indices to gain information about the cluster's structure, nodes, and configurations, which can be used for further attacks.
7.Attackers exploit misconfigured Elasticsearch clusters to access or manipulate snapshot APIs, potentially leading to data theft or corruption of backups.
8.Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Elasticsearch's role-based access controls to gain higher privileges.
9.Elasticsearch lacks adequate logging or monitoring mechanisms, making it difficult to detect or trace malicious activities.
10.Attackers add a malicious node to an Elasticsearch cluster, potentially gaining access to data or influencing cluster behavior.
11.Attackers utilize dynamic scripting capabilities to run malicious scripts, leading to potential data exposure or server exploits.
12.Attackers access internal or system indices that may expose sensitive information about the Elasticsearch environment or its data.
13.Attackers position themselves between Elasticsearch clients and servers, intercepting, modifying, or redirecting queries and responses.
14.In the absence of encryption (e.g., using HTTPS), data transferred between Elasticsearch nodes or between client and server can be intercepted and read by attackers.
15.Attackers find exposed API keys related to Elasticsearch, allowing them unauthorized access or the ability to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.


Countermeasures and Mitigations
Implement strong authentication methods like multi-factor authentication (MFA), employ strong passwords, and properly configure access rights.
Do not expose Elasticsearch clusters to the internet. Use firewalls, VPNs, and reverse proxies to limit access.
Regularly update Elasticsearch to the latest version and patch vulnerabilities. Limit permissions of Elasticsearch service accounts.
Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can modify data. Enable index-level security.
Implement rate limiting, and use protective measures like proxies or Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
Limit access to metadata and system indices via access controls and firewalls. Disable unnecessary features and indices.
Use strong authentication and authorization policies for snapshot APIs. Only expose APIs to trusted networks.
Regularly review and update role-based access control settings. Patch to the latest Elasticsearch version.
Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring, and use tools like Elasticsearch's own X-Pack or other SIEM tools.
Use node-to-node encryption and only allow trusted nodes to join the cluster. Authenticate each node.
Disable dynamic scripting or restrict it to only trusted users and safe operations.
Limit and monitor access to internal or system indices through access controls and firewalls.
Use HTTPS and certificate-based authentication between clients and servers.
Use HTTPS for data in transit and encryption at rest for data storage.
Never hardcode API keys. Use secure methods for storage and retrieval of API keys, like environment variables or secret management services.
