Failure to secure backups can lead attackers to gain unauthorized access to backup files, leading to data exposure.
Some Redis configurations may allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
Attackers could alter data in Redis, leading to misinformation or malicious activities.
Using default credentials can give attackers unauthorized access if they're not changed after installation.
Malicious requests can flood Redis, causing excessive memory utilization and potential service interruptions.
Attackers might exploit configurations to store large amounts of data in Redis, causing it to use excessive memory and potentially crash.
Unsecured Redis configurations or lack of encryption can lead to unintentional data exposure.
Attackers can intentionally overwrite keys, causing data loss or corruption.
Exploiting vulnerabilities in Redis' Lua scripting to execute arbitrary code.
If Redis communication isn't encrypted, attackers could potentially intercept data.
Attackers may exploit input validation vulnerabilities in applications using Redis to inject malicious commands.
Malicious nodes could mimic legitimate nodes, leading to data breaches in replication setups.
Redis snapshots (.rdb files) stored without proper security can be accessed, leading to data breaches.
Redis instances without proper authentication can be accessed by unauthorized users. This could lead to unauthorized operations on data.
Attackers could subscribe to a Redis Pub/Sub channel and eavesdrop on sensitive data.
Leaking the Redis version through errors or headers may give potential attackers insight into known vulnerabilities.
