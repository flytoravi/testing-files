Attackers gain unauthorized access to messages in the queue, potentially exposing sensitive information. This threat arises due to weak authentication, authorization, or improper configuration.
Attackers capture and resend valid messages from the queue, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, duplicate processing, or data corruption.
Messages in the queue are altered maliciously, leading to incorrect data being processed or acted upon by the receiving application component.
Attackers send messages that the receiving application cannot handle, potentially causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
Attackers delete messages from the queue before they can be processed, leading to data loss or system disruption.
Attackers flood the message queue with numerous messages, causing it to become overwhelmed and potentially crash or become slow to respond.
Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the messaging queue system to gain higher privileges, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions.
The messaging queue system lacks sufficient logging and monitoring, making it difficult to detect or trace malicious activities.
Attackers induce errors in the messaging queue system to obtain error messages that may disclose sensitive information about the system's inner workings or configurations.
Attackers exploit systems where default credentials haven't been changed, gaining unauthorized access to the messaging queue.
Attackers position themselves between the sender and receiver in the messaging system, intercepting, modifying, or redirecting messages.
Users or applications are granted more permissions than necessary in the messaging system, allowing unauthorized actions or data exposures.
Attackers exploit vulnerabilities associated with outdated or legacy protocols still supported by the messaging system.
